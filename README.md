# About Me:

I'm an aspiring Computer Architect looking to become a Doctor in my relevant field, as such my profiency lies in C/C++ and Assembly. My primary skills involve Reverse Engineering, Low Level infrastructures, and understanding of Systems Engineering through Emulation and Disassembly.

I heavily specialise in the study and understanding of the architectural design of Computers, which allows me to flourish in my works.

An area of interest that has caught my eye recently is the technical challenges of compiler theory and static recompilation. Working on my [Hitachi SuperH Instruction Decoder](https://github.com/hazzaclark/catherine) has been a testament to that - exploring the concepts of creating a simple and scalable API for decoding and recompiling between architectures.
